This was my first hackathon meetup and having a business background, 
I didn't really know what to expect. The hack theme was learning to 
"code" games with code.org's Hour of Code (http://code.org), though,
no coding experience was needed for beginners. Also my first time at 
the Nouspace Gallery & Media Lounge, a video game workspace curated 
by WSU Vancouver (http://dtc-wsuv.org/wp/nouspace). There is a video 
game exhibition going on at Nouspace from March 6-28, 2015.

You can also get free game curriculum from GarageGames Interactive 
(http://www.gginteractive.com), a Vancouver WA company. Check out
their demo for more info:

If you want to save your progress on the Hour of Code (code.org), sign 
up as a student and select 21+ on the age, if you aren't a student at 
all and simply curious about game design.
